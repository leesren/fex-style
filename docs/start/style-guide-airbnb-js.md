# Airbnb JavaScript 风格指南

A mostly reasonable approach to JavaScript

::: tip
Note: this guide assumes you are using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), and requires that you use babel-preset-airbnb or the equivalent. It also assumes you are installing shims/polyfills in your app, with airbnb-browser-shims or the equivalent.

This guide is available in other languages too. See Translation
